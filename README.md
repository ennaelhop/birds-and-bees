# The Birds and The Bees
A 2D side scroller we made during BCGameJam 2020. It was my first game jam, and my very first hands-on experience with Unity! I was in a group of 5 people and mostly did the programming and main menu for the game.

The theme for the jam was "Prevail".

## Instructions 
Use W,A,S,D or the arrow keys to move the little birdie. Avoid the obstacles along the way until you reach a birdhouse checkpoint.
